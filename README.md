# ARMGDDN Games Redist Installer

Welcome to the ARMGDDN Games Redist Installer! Because why spend hours downloading and installing redistributables when you can spend minutes watching our installer do it for you?

## üöÄ Features

- Install all the redistributables you never knew you needed (but totally do)
- Dark mode for those late-night installing sessions
- A fancy GUI that makes clicking "Next" feel like a real accomplishment
- Automatic detection of installed redistributables (we're psychic like that)
- Multi-select functionality for when you're feeling extra productive

## üõ† Installation

### Release
1. Run the damn .exe

### Python script

1. Clone this repository (or download it, we're not picky)
2. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably a version that doesn't hate you)
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5 requests appdirs
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python AGredist_installer.py
   ```
5. Sit back, relax, and watch the magic happen

## üïπ Usage

1. Launch the application (you've got this far, you can do it!)
2. Choose your architecture (x86 for hipsters, x64 for everyone else)
3. Select the redistributables you want to install
4. Click "Install Selected" and prepare to be amazed
5. Marvel at the progress text as it fills you with a sense of accomplishment

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Developer Mode

Think you're special? Try clicking the logo 10 times. We dare you.

## üëΩ Troubleshooting

- If the installer doesn't work, try turning it off and on again
- If that doesn't work, blame your antivirus
- If youre antivirus isnt to blame its likely a PEBCAK error.
- If all else fails, contact our support team (see below)
