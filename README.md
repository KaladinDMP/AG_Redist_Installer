# ARMGDDN Games Redist Installer

Welcome to the ARMGDDN Games Redist Installer! Because why spend hours downloading and installing redistributables when you can spend minutes watching our installer do it for you?

## üöÄ Features

- Install all the redistributables you never knew you needed (but totally do)
- Dark mode for those late-night installing sessions
- A fancy GUI that makes clicking "Next" feel like a real accomplishment
- Automatic detection of installed redistributables (we're psychic like that)
- Multi-select functionality for when you're feeling extra productive
- Now with more redists than ever! (Because apparently, there's always room for more)

## üõ† Installation

### Release

1. Run the damn .exe

### Python script

1. Clone this repository (or download it, we're not picky)
2. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably a version that doesn't hate you)
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python AGredist_installer.py
   ```
5. Sit back, relax, and watch the magic happen

## üïπ Usage

1. Launch the application (you've got this far, you can do it!)
2. Choose your architecture (x86 for hipsters, x64 for everyone else)
3. Select the redistributables you want to install
4. Click "Install Selected", "Install All", or "Install Not Installed" and prepare to be amazed
5. Marvel at the progress text as it fills you with a sense of accomplishment

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Developer Mode

Think you're special? Try clicking the logo 10 times. We dare you. Now with added features:
- Reset installation status (for when you want to pretend you never installed anything)
- Redownload Redist JSON from GitHub (because who doesn't love fresh data?)

## üëΩ Troubleshooting

- If the installer doesn't work, try turning it off and on again
- If that doesn't work, blame your antivirus
- If your antivirus isn't to blame, it's likely a PEBCAK error
- If you get a weird error saying something is outdated or depreciated, try running ```for /F "skip=2 tokens=1" %i in ('pip list --outdated') do pip install --upgrade %i``` and update all your modules
- If all else fails, contact our support team (see below)

## üôè Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Microsoft for making so many redistributables that we needed to create this tool
- Shoutout to caffeine and cigarettes, the true heroes behind this project
- Special thanks to you, for actually reading this README. You're the real MVP!

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use this installer wisely, and may your system be forever redistributable-complete!

ALSO: Please feel free to contact me with more redists and links or just send a merge request. The more, the merrier (and by merrier, we mean more stable and compatible)!
